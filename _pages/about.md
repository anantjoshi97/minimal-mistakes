## About the Blog
At the very beginning, I want to thank you for going through my blog posts. The blog is nothing but some documentation of what I meet and think in my everyday life. I started this blog intending to write down about different pros & cons of **Education**, **Research**, and **Travel**. As I am involved with the academic arena, most posts are intended primarily to help my students and juniors. 

Why writing? Without documentation, we forget how we do or improve what we did before. That's the primary concern for me. Therefore, if there is an area of improvement in my posts, please feel free to let me know with your feedback. Thanks again.

## About Myself
I love learning, researching, exploring new things, and creating new hobbies. I have been working as a Research Assistant and has enrolled as a Ph.D. student at the Department of Computer Science, University of Houston since Fall-2019. My primary research interest is in Cyber Security, Data Science & ML, SDN, Cloud-IoT ecosystem etc.

Currently, I am researching on Cyber Deception based on SDN and Game Theory. Previously, I worked on data collection, filtering, analyzing, and visualization of smart contract related posts from Medium.com after joining the RNS Lab at UH.

Before joining UH, I worked as a lecturer in the Dept. of CSE, Green University of Bangladesh. I like to collaborate with other researchers and together we have been working on projects and publications. I also like to have hands-on experiences on System Administration that made me take part in RHCSA, RHCE, Openstack,CCNA etc vendor courses, and exams. I intend to gather more knowledge that covers the topics of DevSecOps. 

I love to travel a lot. I love sports too, the most favorite one is obviously cycling. Apart from that I play cricket and football. Photgraphy and music attracts me as well. In spare times, I like to read Quora discussions and to watch movies. life is short, so much to explore, isn't it..? :)
