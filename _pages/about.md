## About the Blog
At the very beginning, I want to thank you for going through my blog posts. The blog is nothing but some documentation of what I meet, think, and learn in my everyday life. I started this blog intending to write down about different pros & cons of **Education** and **Research** based on what I learn in my `PhD life`. You will find a lot of helpful posts and tutorials about `Documentation with Latex` and `Data Science in Python` as well. Apart from that, I will keep posting about my other thoughts that can help you learning new things or maintaining the work-life balance. I like to travel and explore new places. So, definitely, there are a few travel diaries as well. :sunglasses:

Why writing? Without documentation, we forget how we do or improve what we did before. That's the primary concern for me. Therefore, if there is an area of improvement in my posts, please feel free to let me know with your feedback. :v:

Obviously, I am not a needy guy. :no_mouth: I will keep writing because I find joy in it. Yet, in case if any of my posts help you solve your problem and you want to thank me for that, you can simply do it by-

## About Myself
I love learning, researching, exploring new things, and creating new hobbies. I have been working as a Research Assistant and have enrolled as a Ph.D. student at the Department of Computer Science, the University of Houston since Fall-2019. My primary research interest is in Cyber Security, Data Science & ML, SDN, Cloud-IoT ecosystem, etc.

Currently, I am researching on `Cyber Deception` based on our findings of  `Cyber Reconnaissance`. Previously, I worked on data collection, filtering, analyzing, and visualization of smart contract related posts from Medium.com after joining the RNS Lab at `University of Houston`.

Before joining UH, I worked as a lecturer in the Dept. of CSE, Green University of Bangladesh. I like to collaborate with other researchers and together we have been working on projects and publications. I also love to have hands-on experiences on System Administration that made me take part in RHCSA, RHCE, Openstack, CCNA, etc vendor courses, and exams. I intend to gather more knowledge that covers the topics of DevSecOps. 

I love to `travel` a lot. I love sports too, the most favorite one is obviously `Cycling`. Apart from that, I play `Cricket` and `Football`(Soccer). `Photography` and music attracts me as well. In my spare time, I like to read Quora discussions and to watch movies. life is short, so much to explore, isn't it..? :)
