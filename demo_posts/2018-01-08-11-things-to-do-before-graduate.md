The graduation period is very important for a student as it is the time s/he starts thinking about his/her career. During this period a student learns how to cope with the market and what should be his role in a particular position. Just after completion, they start looking out for job opprotunities. 

In this article, I will recommend 11 things a **Computer Science (CS/CSE)** or **Information Technology (IT)** student should do before completing his graduation. 

>"Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition." - Steve Jobs [^1]

## 1. Master one programming language
Before completing graduation, master at least one programming language. To cope with the progressing technologies, coding skill has become the most primary need unless you plan for a career change. Most of the students become confused when they are suggested to choose that choice. Although it entirely depends on the field you choose. Because every single programming language has different specialities- that means languages have particular functionalities and advantages over other languages. 

For example, data scientists always prefer [`Python`][Python programming] and [`R`][R programming] programming languages [^2] because these languages have better built-in functions to work over data. ACM programmer's preferable choice is [`C++`][C++ programming] for competitive programming [^3] [^4] [^5]. On the other hand, [`PHP`][PHP] along with [`MySQL`][MySQL] is quite popular in terms of developing web applications. So, one need to choose a particular language acording to his preferable arena.

## 2. Start a personal website
Yes, definitely you need a personal website before completing your graduation. A personal site not only talks for you but also it provides you the continuous platform to update your portfolio and CV. Profile development is a coninuous process and a personal site stands as the showcase of your achievements, experiences and future goals. Also, it helps enhancing professional networks and marketing your skills. 

A blog with personal site enriches your visibility. I always suggest to have a blog as it is one kind of notebook or personal diary to me. It enhances one's writing skill as well. And if English is not your native language, maybe blogging can become the best platfor for you to master your writing skills in English. And who doesn't want to do that!!! 


## 3. Have basic ideas on every sector of IT arenas
If you already are expert in one sector, that's very good. But, necessarily you should have the basics of other IT arenas as well. The market is being more competitive day by day and if you want to show yourself from thousands, you'll definitely need knowledge on other sectors thereby. Have basic knowledge on structured programming, OOP, web programming, networking, server systems, database, software & web development and definitely Cloud. Using cloud, it will seem to have a super computer on your pocket. If you can utilize cloud, you won't have to buy a heavy performance computer or laptop; simply a normal machine with a browser will do the work. 

And today, hands-on experience is always preferred over just theoratical knowledge in IT arena. Also, entreprenuership skill needs overall knowledge on every other aspects. So, even being a CSE or IT student you need to know the marketing skill as well. Because you have to market not only your product but also your skill.

## 4. Write a CV/Resume
Prepare a CV/Resume while continuing in your final year. You can write it using MS Word or Latex. In this case, Latex is my personal favorite. You will find a lot of CV/Resume templates in [`Overleaf`][Overleaf] or [`ShareLatex`][ShareLatex] - two popular cloud based platform. 

If you prefer MS word, then you will find some templates for CV/Resume or cover letter in [`Office templates`][t1] or [`Office templates 2`][t2]. Also you can create and customize your CV online using a free platform - [`Hloom`][Hloom].

## 5. Attend seminars, workshops or conferences
Attend regularly at different IT oriented seminars and workshops. The more will you participate the more your boundary of knowledge or experience will expand. Also this is a good chance to engage more with professional people and enhance your netwok. At the end of the day, you will come to know about new trends, best practices and state of the art in every IT/business sector.

Students who are preparing themselves to join in academic arena, should attend at least one conference. If you can submit a manuscript/conference paper, got accepted and present there;  you'll have the opportunity to know and collaborate other academic scholars. People will review your work which in result give you a proper direction for future works. If you don't have a paper to present, you can also participate in poster presentation where you can present an idea. Additionally, you can participae in project showcasing if you have a project done while doing regular classwork. 

Basically seminars, workshops and conferences give you the opportunity to meet people with whom you will work in future. It enhances your professional network, and by participating in these, you will be able to build your community.

## 6. Take professional courses
ALthough, it's a busy schedule in the final year of your graduation, it will be effective if you have at least one professional course on your preferred arena. Additionally, having a vendor/professional exam certificate will enrich your profile and accelerate the possibilty for securing a job in no time after graduation. 

In my case, I completed two courses- `*Red Hat Enterprise Administration*` and `*Red Hat Enterprise Engineering*` and attended the certification exams knowing that I will enter in system administration. But, although later I entered in academic career, these two yet gave me some professionalexperiences, boosted my confidence and weighted my profile. Therefore, I will suggest you to take at least one course according to your preferred arena.
