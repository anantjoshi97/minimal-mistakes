The graduation period is very important for a student as it is the time s/he starts thinking about his/her career. During this period a student learns how to cope with the market and what should be his role in a particular position. Just after completion, they start looking out for job opprotunities. 

In this article, I recommend 11 things a **Computer Science (CS/CSE)** or **Information Technology (IT)** student should do before completing his graduation. 

>"Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition." - Steve Jobs [^1]

## 11 things to do before completion of graduation in CSE/IT
### 1. Master one programming language
Before completing graduation, master at least one programming language. To cope with the progressing technologies, coding skill has become the most primary need unless you plan for a career change. Most of the students become confused when they are suggested to choose that choice. Although it entirely depends on the field you choose. Because all programming languages have different specialities- means languages have particular functionalities and advantages over other languages.
