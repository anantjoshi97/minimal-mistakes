The graduation period is very important for a student as it is the time s/he starts thinking about his/her career. During this period a student learns how to cope with the market and what should be his role in a particular position. Just after completion, they start looking out for job opprotunities. 

In this article, I recommend 11 things a **Computer Science (CS/CSE)** or **Information Technology (IT)** student should do before completing his graduation. 

>"Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition." - Steve Jobs [^1]

## 1. Master one programming language
Before completing graduation, master at least one programming language. To cope with the progressing technologies, coding skill has become the most primary need unless you plan for a career change. Most of the students become confused when they are suggested to choose that choice. Although it entirely depends on the field you choose. Because every single programming language has different specialities- that means languages have particular functionalities and advantages over other languages. 

For example, data scientists always prefer [`Python`][Python programming] and [`R`][R programming] programming languages [^2] because these languages have better built-in functions to work over data. ACM programmer's preferable choice is [`C++`][C++ programming] for competitive programming [^3] [^4] [^5]. On the other hand, [`PHP`][PHP] along with [`MySQL`][MySQL] is quite popular in terms of developing web applications. So, one need to choose a particular language acording to his preferable arena.

## 2. Start a personal website
Yes, definitely you need a personal website before completing your graduation. A personal site not only talks for you but also it provides you the continuous platform to update your portfolio and CV. Profile development is a coninuous process and a personal site stands as the showcase of your achievements, experiences and future goals. Also, it helps enhancing professional networks and marketing your skills. 

A blog with personal site enriches your visibility. I always suggest to have a blog as it is one kind of notebook or personal diary to me. It enhances one's writing skill as well. And if English is not your native language, maybe blogging can become the best platfor for you to master your writing skills in English. And who doesn't want to do that!!! 


## 3. Have basic ideas on every sector of IT arenas
If you already are expert in one sector, that's very good. But, necessarily you should have the basics of other IT arenas as well. The market is being more competitive day by day and if you want to show yourself from thousands, you'll definitely need knowledge on other sectors thereby. Have basic knowledge on structured programming, OOP, web programming, networking, server systems, database, software & web development and definitely Cloud. Using cloud, it will seem to have a super computer on your pocket. If you can utilize cloud, you won't have to buy a heavy performance computer or laptop; simply a normal machine with a browser will do the work. 

And today, hands-on experience is always preferred over just theoratical knowledge in IT arena. Also, entreprenuership skill needs overall knowledge on every other aspects. So, even being a CSE or IT student you need to know the marketing skill as well. Because you have to market not only your product but also your skill.

## 4. Write a CV/Resume
## 5. Attend seminars, workshops or conferences
## 6. Take professional courses
## 7. Create a LinkedIn profile
## 8. Find a mentor
## 9. Build a network
## 10. Practice public speaking
## 11. Enhance writing/documentation skill
